Separation Logic for Distributed Systems Verification\\
A formalization in Isabelle/HOL}

\newpage

This is a generated file containing all of our definitions, theorems and proofs that we formalized in Isabelle/HOL in a human-readable form. 
The section \emph{Matching theorems from paper to the formalization} correlates the theorem and lemmas from the paper with their corresponding Isabelle formalization.
In particular, the theory dependencies given in the figure on the next page are useful.
Nevertheless, the most convenient way of browsing the Isabelle theories is to use the Isabelle GUI. See the README for details.
